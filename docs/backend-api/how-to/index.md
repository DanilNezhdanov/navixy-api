# How to

Working with API might seem hard at first, but the goal of our documentation is to assist you in this process and make
it more approachable.

Our "How to" section has step-by-step examples of working with the Navixy API.

From initial step of obtaining an API key hash to more complicated operations like retrieving a list of devices, tracks or
creating reports. Using API and scripting you will be able to develop applications that not only satisfy your customer's
needs but also help you make your business more profitable.
